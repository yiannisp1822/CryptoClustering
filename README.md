# CryptoClustering

The notebook appears to perform clustering analysis on cryptocurrency market data, using techniques like normalization with StandardScaler, clustering with KMeans, and dimensionality reduction with PCA. Here’s a draft of a README file for this project:

**Crypto Clustering Project**

This project demonstrates a machine-learning approach to analyzing and clustering cryptocurrencies based on their market data. The notebook employs techniques like normalization, clustering, and dimensionality reduction to identify patterns in the cryptocurrency market.

**Project Structure**

	•	Notebook: Crypto_Clustering.ipynb
	•	Data: Input data file is located at Resources/crypto_market_data.csv.

**Getting Started**  

Prerequisites:
Ensure you have Python installed with the following libraries:
	•	pandas
	•	scikit-learn

Install the required libraries using:  
pip install pandas scikit-learn

**Running the Notebook**

	1.	Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook Crypto_Clustering.ipynb  


	2.	Follow the steps outlined in the notebook, which include:
		•Loading and exploring the data.
		•Normalizing the data using StandardScaler.
		•Applying clustering algorithms like KMeans.
		•Reducing dimensions with PCA for visualization.

**Project Workflow**

	1. Data Loading: Loads cryptocurrency market data with key performance metrics such as percentage price changes over different periods.
	2. Data Preprocessing: Normalizes the data using StandardScaler to ensure consistent scaling.
	3. Clustering: Groups cryptocurrencies into clusters using the KMeans algorithm.
	4. Dimensionality Reduction: Reduces data dimensions with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for visual interpretation.

**Output**

	•Cluster assignments for cryptocurrencies.
	•Visualization of clusters in reduced dimensions.
